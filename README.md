## Dropbox Exercise

![](https://github.com/swndr/codepath-week-one/blob/master/Dropbox%20Demo.gif)

I spent about 10 hours on this.

Completed basic assignment plus some extras:
* Swipe through intro screen, plus both the sign in buttons work here (not showing video)
* Added text fields to both forms, with appropriate keyboard settings (e.g capitaliazation, email, secure entry)
* Can tab through text fields with 'Next' and complete with 'Done'
* Added password strength indicator that works, based on length
* Logic for enabling 'Create' button based on form completion and agreeing to terms
* Logic for enabling 'Sign In' button based on form completion and password length
* Used real action sheets on both forms
* Added way to open camera roll from the Photos tab, though you can't actually import anything
